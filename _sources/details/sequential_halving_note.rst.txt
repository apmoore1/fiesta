:Note: This approach has been shown to outperform the standard non-adpative FB 
       approach as shown in this `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12230>`_ 
       associated to this code base and the following 
       `notebook tutorial <https://github.com/apmoore1/fiesta/blob/master/notebooks/Advantages_of_Model_Selection.ipynb>`_ 
       from this code based. Outperform here means that given the same budget 
       :math:`T` we are more likely to find the best model.
