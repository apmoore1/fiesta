This is the standard approach where the budget :math:`T` is spent fairly across 
all of the :math:`N` models. The best model :math:`N^*` would be the model that 
has the highest mean score across all of the evaluations.
 
:Example: Given :math:`T=10` and :math:`N=5` we would give each of the :math:`N` models 
          :math:`2` evaluations each.
