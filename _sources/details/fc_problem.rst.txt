Given a set of models :math:`N` can we find the best model :math:`N^*` with a 
confidence greater than or equal to :math:`(1 - p)` 
where :math:`p` is our p-value. For example if we want to find the model that 
is the best model with 95% confidence we would set :math:`p=0.05`.

Compared to the Fixed Budget approach here we find the best model and know that 
it is the best model with :math:`(1 - p)` confidence.
