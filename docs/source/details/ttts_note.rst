:Note: This approach has been shown to outperform the standard non-adpative FC
       approach as shown in this `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12230>`_ 
       associated to this code base and the following 
       `notebook tutorial <https://github.com/apmoore1/fiesta/blob/master/notebooks/Advantages_of_Model_Selection.ipynb>`_ 
       from this code based. Outperform here means that we find the best model 
       in fewer number of evaluations/runs.
